As a viewer, I came away from the film with the same sense of \"shock and awe\" as when I first saw The Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner\\'s startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt Judy was deserving of her Grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the Godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.'"

The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",

What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable.
